== Description ==

OWMS for Wordpress is a plugin that inserts meta data into the displayed posts. It is a meta data standard developed for the meta enrichment of Dutch government information. The standard is currently at 3.5, and a proposal for OWMS 4.0 is currently under consideration. 

**Features**

* Easy â€“ Just upload and activate the plugin.
* Default selection - You can select defaults that apply to each post. These are then auto-filled when you create a post, so it saves time!
